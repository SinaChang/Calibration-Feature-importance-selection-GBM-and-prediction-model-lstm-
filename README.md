# Financial Time Series Prediction with LSTM

## Overview
This project focuses on calibrating a predictive model using Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks to analyze financial time series data. The calibration process involves data pre-processing, cleaning, analysis, feature importance and selection, culminating in the development of an LSTM prediction model.

## 1. Data Pre-processing
### Considerations
- **Data Integrity and Quality:** Ensuring accurate and reliable financial data.
- **Visualization:** Utilizing graphical representations to identify data quality issues.
- **Modular Code Structure:** Enhancing maintenance ease and scalability.
- **Efficiency:** Prioritizing efficient handling of large data volumes.

### Preliminary Data Visualization
- Identification of linear, non-linear, and no correlation patterns to guide model selection.

## 2. Data Cleaning and Processing
### Data Cleaning
- Focus on identifying low variance parameters and high uniqueness parameters.
- Employing strategies to ensure high-quality, relevant data, including the removal of columns with a high ratio of bad values.

### Insights from Pre-Processing
- Refining the dataset to improve its quality by removing columns with significant bad values.

## 3. Preliminary Analysis
### Plotting Feature Distributions
- Observation of central tendencies and symmetry.
- Suggestion of further preprocessing steps like outlier treatment and normalization.

### Linear Regression Analysis
- Utilization of linear regression to identify linear relationships between variables.

## 4. Feature Importance and Selection
### Feature Importance
- Use of gradient boosting machines (GBM) to determine feature importance.
- 
## 5. LSTM for Prediction
### Core Mechanism and Consideration
- Exploration of the advantages of LSTM in handling time series data.

## Conclusion
The systematic approach to data handling, analysis, and modeling emphasizes the importance of data integrity, the utility of feature importance in model optimization, and the effectiveness of LSTM models for predicting financial time series data.
